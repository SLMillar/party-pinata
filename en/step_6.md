What would you write in a birthday card to send to Code Club? It could be something about:
+ Your favourite thing about Code Club
+ Your fabulous Code Club leader
+ Details of what you want to make next

The first Code Club projects were written in English but within a year they had been translated into Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, German, Norwegian and Ukrainian. French, Greek and Spanish translations quickly followed and now there are projects in <span style="color: #0faeb0">**28 native languages**</span>. Thank you to our awesome translation community!
