## Add some treats

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Pi単atas are full of treats and when they start to break the treats fall out. In this step, animate global food treats to fall out of the pi単ata each time it is hit.

A <span style="color: #0faeb0">**costume**</span> in Scratch is an image that changes the way a sprite looks. Our graphic designers asked Code Club leaders around the world to tell them what treats they would have at a party. Hopefully some of these treat costumes will be familiar to you - and others completely new.
