## Start the party

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step, you will choose a piñata costume and code the piñata to swing.

Open the [Party piñata starter project](http://rpf.io/scratch-new){:target="_blank"}. Scratch will open in another browser tab.

The Scratch editor looks like this:

The **Stage** is where your project runs and a **backdrop** changes the way that the Stage looks. A Code Club party backdrop has been added for you. 

At the moment there is not much happening at this party. You can change that! 

--- task ---

A sprite can have code, costumes, and sounds to change the way that it looks and what it does.

Click on the **Piñata** sprite and select the **Costumes** tab. 

There are two Code Club robots to choose from and each has 'whole' and 'broken' costumes. 

**Choose:** Click on the costumes to see them and decide which robot piñata costume you want to use at your party, **blah1** or **blah2**. 

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click on the **Code** tab. Go to the 'Looks' blocks menu and drag a 'switch costume to' block to the Code area. 

Click on the costume name to open a drop-down menu. Click on your chosen 'whole' costume to select it.

--- /task ---

Blocks can be connected together in the Code area to run more than one at a time. Connected blocks will run in order from top to bottom.

--- task ---

Go to the 'Events' blocks menu and drag at 'When flag clicked' block to the Code area. 

Drag a 'When flag clicked' block from the 'Events' blocks menu and connect it to the top of your looks block in the Code area. The blocks will snap together.

The starting position of a piñata is always the same, it only starts moving when the piñata game is ready. 

In the 'Motion' blocks menu, find the 'point in direction 90' block. Drag the block to the Code area and connect it to the bottom of your code.   

--- /task ---

A 'forever' loop runs the code blocks inside it again and again. It is the perfect loop for a swinging piñata that is hard to hit.

--- task ---

Drag a 'forever' block from the 'Control' blocks menu and connect it to the bottom of your code.

--- /task ---

A 'repeat' loop can be used to make the piñata repeat a small movement many times. This will make the piñata appear animated.

--- task ---

Drag a 'repeat' '10' block from the Control blocks menu and attach it inside your 'forever' loop. 

Go to the 'Motion' blocks menu and drag a 'turn right 15 degrees' block into the 'repeat' block. 

Change the '15' degrees to '1' degree so that the piñata only swings a small amount each time.

--- /task ---

**Test:** Run your project to see the piñata swing. 

Something is not quite right. When an object is hung from the ceiling, it will continue to swing not just to the right but to the left aswell. 

--- task ---

Add code to your 'forever' loop so that the piñata swings from the centre back and forth continously.

**Test:** Run your project to see the piñata swing.
