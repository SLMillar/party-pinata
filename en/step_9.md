### Animation using loops
[Catch the bus](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/catch-the-bus){:target="_blank"} - code sprites to make repeated small movements to look like walking or flying to catch, or miss, the bus.

### Editing sounds

### Broadcast messages
[Broadcasting spells](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/broadcasting-spells){:target="_blank"} - use messages to cast spells that turn sprites into toads, grow, or shrink them.
