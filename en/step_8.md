## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas about what to add already! 

You could:

+ Use more looks, sounds or motion blocks to animate your message and treats further
+ Increase the number of treats that fall from the piñata on each hit
+ Make your project easier or harder by changing the number of times you need to hit the piñata before it breaks
