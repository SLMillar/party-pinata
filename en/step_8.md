## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas about what to add already! 

You could:

+ Use more looks, sounds or motion blocks to animate your message and treats further
+ Find images of your favorite treats and add them to the costumes for the Treats sprite
+ Increase the number of treats that fall from the piñata on each hit
+ Make your project easier or harder by changing the number of times you need to hit the piñata before it breaks

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Did you know you can add code to the backdrop too?

What happens to the backdrop when the piñata breaks? Which blocks would create this effect?

You could add code to make the message animate `forever`{:class="block3control"} when it is in position. Use `change size`{:class="block3looks"} and `change color effect`{:class="block3looks"} blocks so that it looks like the message is moving with the party beat: 

![The message sprite icon.](images/message-sprite.png)

```blocks3
when I receive [party v]
show
repeat (20)
change size by (5)
change y by (-10)
end
+ forever
change size by (20) // positive number to grow
change [color v] effect by (25) // change colour
wait (0.5) seconds // try different numbers to match your music
change size by (-20) // negative number to shrink
```
