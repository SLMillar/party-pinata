## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project. You might have ideas about what to add already! 

You could:

+ Use more looks, sounds or motion blocks to animate your message and treats further
+ Find images of your favorite treats and add them to the costumes for the Treats sprite
+ Increase the number of treats that fall from the piñata on each hit
+ Make your project easier or harder by changing the number of times you need to hit the piñata before it breaks

### Try it
<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">  
Did you know you can add code to the backdrop too?

What happens to the backdrop when the piñata breaks? Which blocks would create this effect?
